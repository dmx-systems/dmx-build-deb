# Upgrading from DMX 5.1 or earlier to DMX 5.2 on headless hosts systems (e.g. a public webserver)
   When upgrading to DMX 5.2 on a non-desktop system, you should manually remove the existing DMX package with `sudo apt remove dmx`.
   Then install the package for headless systems with `sudo apt install dmx-headless`. Your data and config files will be preserved.
