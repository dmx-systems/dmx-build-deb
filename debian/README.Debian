# DMX for Debian

The DMX Debian package uses Linuxâ€™ File System Hierarchy Standard. You find the respective components in the directories listed below:

- Configuration files: `/etc/dmx/`
- Java files: `/usr/share/dmx/`
- DMX database (and eventually file repo): `/var/lib/dmx/`
- Log files: `/var/log/dmx/`
- Bundle cache: `/var/cache/dmx/`
- Examples: `/usr/share/doc/dmx/`
- Systemd unit file: `/lib/systemd/system/dmx.service`

## Configuration

Please read the [DMX Admin Guide](https://dmx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin.html). By default, DMX is listening on localhost, port 8080. To change this setting, edit `/etc/dmx/config.properties`. Adjust the settings in /etc/dmx/config.properties and make sure your computer is protected by a firewall. **Important**: In a networked installation modify `dmx.filerepo.path`! We recommend to set it to a dedicated directory, e.g. `dmx.filerepo.path = /var/lib/dmx/dmx-filedir`.

`dpkg -P` dmx will remove all installed files but not delete your database and files in `/var/lib/dmx`.

## Apache

See `/usr/share/doc/dmx/examples/dmx.apache` for a sample Apache2 config file. Our documentation contains more details about [Apache configuration](https://dmx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin.html#running-dmx-behind-an-apache-reverse-proxy).

## Security

[Secure your installation](https://dmx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin.html#securing-dmx) with iptables.
