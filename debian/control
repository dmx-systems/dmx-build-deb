Description: semantic web platform for knowledge management and collaboration
 DeepaMehta is a software platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
 Knowledge is represented in a semantic network and is handled collaboratively.
 DeepaMehta combines interdisciplinary research with the idea of free and open
 source software to generate a true benefit for workflow as well as for social
 processes. The DeepaMehta user interface is build according to research in
 cognitive psychology and accommodates the knowledge building process of the
 individual. Instead of handling information through applications, windows and
 files with DeepaMehta the user handles all kind of information directly and
 individually. DeepaMehta's user interface is completely based on concept maps.
