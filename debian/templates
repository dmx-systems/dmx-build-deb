 Since DMX version 5.2 there are two different packages:
 1. dmx - the default package for desktop systems (your private computer).
 2. dmx-headless - a package for non-desktop systems (public web-server).
 It is highly recommended to uninstall the previously installed package (sudo apt remove dmx)
 and to install the dmx-headless package instead (sudo apt install dmx-headless).
